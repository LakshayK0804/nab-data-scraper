# NBA Player Stats
A python program that uses the nba website API to scrape NBA Player stats from the 2010 season till the 2024 season.
You can change the program to get stats from earlier seasons too depending upon your needs. To get data from years before 2010 or after 2024(in the future) go into scraper.py and enter more years in the same format into the years array.
Thank you for using my program and Enjoy!
