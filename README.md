# NBA Player Stats
A python program that uses the nba website API to scrape NBA Player stats from the 2010 season till the 2024 season.
You can change the program to get stats from earlier seasons too depending upon your needs. To get data from years before 2010 or after 2024(in the future) go into scraper.py and enter more years in the same format into the years array.
Thank you for using my program and Enjoy!

# Requirements
To run the provided code, you need the following Python libraries installed:

	1.	pandas
	2.	requests
	3.	numpy

Hereâ€™s how you can install these libraries using pip:
```pip install pandas requests numpy```

# Future
I plan on using this scraper and data to make a website that is sort of similiar to a chatbot that gives you the information you want by using the data and filtering and fetching it. My end goal is to create an AI bot that uses this data and gives users player prop suggestions for betting. Although that is a long reach but it is most definitely possible.
